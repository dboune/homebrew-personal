How do I install these formulae?
--------------------------------
Just `brew tap dboune/personal` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from mxcl/master or another tap, you can `brew install dboune/personal/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.github.com/dboune/homebrew-personal/master/<formula>.rb
```
